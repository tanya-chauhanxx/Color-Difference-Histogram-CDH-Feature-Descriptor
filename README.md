# Color-Difference-Histogram-CDH-Feature-Descriptor
Introduction
This repository contains my project on implementing a Color Difference Histogram (CDH) feature descriptor for content-based image retrieval (CBIR). The CDH approach focuses on leveraging color differences to generate robust feature vectors for image analysis and retrieval tasks.

Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:

Develop an efficient algorithm for computing CDH descriptors.
Apply the descriptors to an image dataset.
Evaluate their effectiveness in CBIR systems.
Features
Implementation of the Color Difference Histogram (CDH) algorithm.
Analysis and visualization of feature descriptors.
Performance evaluation using a CBIR task.
Code structured for scalability and reusability.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib
Platform: Google Colab
